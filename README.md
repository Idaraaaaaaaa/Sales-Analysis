# Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data to provide insights into annual performance of sales reps. The data was cleaned and processed using Jupyter Notebook, and visualized using Tableau.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess sales data.
- Visualize annual sales performance by representatives.
- Provide insights into sales trends and performance.

## Data Sources

- OfficeSupplies.csv : Sales data CSV file which is to be cleaned by Jupyter notebook.
- Office_Supplies.csv : Cleaned data for exporting into Tableau.

## Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## Process

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Loaded the sales data CSV file into Jupyter Notebook.
   - Cleaned the data, handling missing values and formatting issues.
   - Exported the cleaned data for visualization.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Imported the cleaned data into Tableau.
   - Created visualizations to represent annual sales performance, including:
     - Total sales by representative.
     - Yearly sales trends.
     - Performance comparisons.

## Dashboard Features

- **Total Sales by Representative**: Displays the total sales for each representative.
- **Yearly Sales Trends**: Visualizes sales performance over time.
- **Performance Comparisons**: Compares the performance of different representatives.

## Benefits

- Enhanced understanding of sales performance.
- Identification of top-performing sales representatives.
- Insights into sales trends for better decision-making.

2. Explore the visualizations to gain insights into sales performance.
3. Use filters to focus on specific representatives or time periods.

## Conclusion

The data indicates a correlation between the number of sales and the duration of sales periods (i.e., the number of months during which sales occurred) and the annual bonuses received by the sales representatives. This analysis provides valuable insights into the annual performance of sales representatives, aiding in strategic decision-making and performance improvement.
